# Alison McCallum - Online Profile

Milestone 1 project - User Centric Frontend Development. 

I have chosen to complete an online profile of myself as the basis of this project to showcase my abilities to prospective tech recruiters in the near future.  

The site is split into 3 sections: 

- Section one contains my main areas of expertise and skills.  
- Section two contains images of my 'make-believe' portfolio with links.
- Section three details some further information covering education, job history, my career aspirations and a contact form.   

## UX

#### User Stories

As a **tech recruiter** recruiting for a web developer role,  I would like to see the following:

- A simple and clear design that showcases the candidate's professional attributes
- Examples or portfolio of previous work
- A method to contact the candidate 

I need to be able to quickly scan the site to confirm initial suitability to a role-type, but with enough relevant detail to  match a specific role if applicable. Layout and clear headings are therefore important to me.

## Features

The site is split into 3 sections with further sub detail in each section as required.

**Section 1**

- Main areas of expertise - This contains 4 descriptions of the areas that I believe are my strongest and most relevant professional capabilities.
- Skills - This provides a quick 1-5 scale of where my skillbase currently sits (This can be updated as and when required). 
- CV - This is download button to a PDF copy of my current CV, which compliments the site.

**Section 2**

This section contains 3 images and web-links to my 'make-believe' portfolio.

**Section 3**

 This further information section provide a brief view of my education and job history.  I have also included my short and long-term career aspirations  which will be useful to a recruiter, as well as a simple contact form for any further discussion points.
