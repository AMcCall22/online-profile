# Alison McCallum - Online Profile

#### Milestone 1 project - User Centric Frontend Development. 

I have chosen to complete an online profile of myself as the basis of this project to showcase my abilities to prospective tech recruiters in the near future.  

The site is split into 3 sections: 

- Section one contains my main areas of expertise and skills.  
- Section two contains images of my 'make-believe' portfolio with links.
- Section three details some further information covering education, job history,  my career aspirations and a contact form.   


## UX

#### User Stories

"*As a **tech recruiter** recruiting for a web developer role,  I would like to see the following:*

- *A simple and clear design that showcases the candidate's professional attributes*
- *Examples or portfolio of previous work*
- *A method to contact the candidate* 

*I need to be able to quickly scan the site to confirm initial suitability to a role-type, but with enough relevant detail to  match a specific role if applicable. Layout and clear headings are therefore important to me."*

This site may also be used for **potential employers** who would have similar requirements as per the above.


#### Wireframes

## Features

The site is split into 3 sections with further sub detail in each section as required.

**Navbar/Header**

I deliberately chose an inline Navbar rather than a burger menu for all screen sizes, as felt it was appropriate for this type of project (Small site and navbar items are easy to view and access. )

**Section 1**

- Main areas of expertise - This contains 4 descriptions of the areas that I believe are my strongest and most relevant professional capabilities.
- Skills - This provides a quick 1-5 scale of where my skillbase currently sits (This can be updated as and when required). 
- CV - This is download button to a PDF copy of my current CV, which compliments the site.

**Section 2**

This section contains 3 images and web-links to my 'make-believe' portfolio.  The use of fake projects was suggested by the milestone project brief, given my limited portfolio to date.

**Section 3**

This further information section provide a brief view of my education and job history.  I have also included my short and long-term career aspirations  which will be useful to a recruiter, as well as a simple contact form for any further discussion points.

### Issues faced and resolved

The main issue faced throughout this project was the background colour and height taking up the full screen when the relevant nav bar item was selected. This was fixed by adding in a class="fullscreen" of 100vh, as well as a height of 100% for each section.

Media queries were added in to compensate for any issues faced, including heading sizes and alignment.  

I also removed my photo on any device smaller than an Ipad as it did not seem necessary.
